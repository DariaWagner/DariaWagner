### Hi, I’m Daria 👋

I’m currently retraining as a **Data & Process Analyst** with a strong focus on **analytics and programming**.

During my retraining, I work with data to understand processes, find patterns, and turn raw information into clear insights.  
I enjoy structured thinking, clean data, and practical solutions that make work easier and more efficient.

### What I focus on:
- Data analysis and data cleaning  
- SQL queries and reporting  
- Python (Pandas, basic automation)  
- Process analysis and documentation  
- Clear and understandable results

### What you’ll find in my GitHub:
This profile contains practical learning and practice projects related to data analysis, programming, and process-oriented thinking.
Each project is documented step by step and shows my analytical approach and continuous learning progress.

### Tech Stack:
Python | SQL | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Excel | Git

I’m motivated, detail-oriented, and continuously developing my technical and analytical skills.
